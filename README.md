# NLP---Text-Classification-
Text Classification using Hugging Face library to classify a dataset of text into one of multiple categories. I will use a pre-trained model BERT as a starting point and fine-tune it on the classification task.

The process of building a text classification model using Hugging Face library and fine-tuning a
pre-trained model such as BERT or GPT-2 on the 20newsgroups dataset. Here are the steps I will
follow:
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load and preprocess the 20newsgroups dataset.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Fine-tune a pre-trained model using the Hugging Face library.
5. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-score.
6. Use the trained model to predict the categories of a few samples from the test set.
